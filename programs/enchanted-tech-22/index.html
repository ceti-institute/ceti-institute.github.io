          <h3>City as Canvas</h3>

          <p>The CETI Summer Institutes are 6 weeks of collaborative learning, play, and creative experiments using cutting edge technologies (xr, creative code, smart tech, interactive objects), art, and music to craft delightful and imaginative interactive objects, stories, spaces, and experiences placed around the city.</p>

          <p>Join us for a summer of <strong></strong>art, technology, craft, fabrication and imagination</strong> as we infuse the cityscape with hidden messages, images, and stories. Through our <strong>workshops and institutes</strong>, learn to create objects, images, music, and experiences (physical and virtual) to reveal fantastical joyful voices, experiences, memories, and futures.</p>

          <p><strong>Our festival</strong> this year will be made up of a series of Institutes for Youth, Educators, Community, and Professionals. <strong>Experimenting</strong> with (and learning) a variety of digital/coding platforms/tools (including p5, unity, 8th wall, ml/ai tools), with <strong>interactivity</strong> (using sensors, microcontrollers, and mobile devices), and with <strong>augmenting reality</strong>, we will introduce techniques, ideas form experts, ending in a <strong>collaborative</strong> show in <strong>September 2022</strong>.</p>

          <p>Objects that create music, that light up when they see us, and that serve as portals to wondrous experiences that reveal hidden stories about our city, that allow us to  walk in somebody else’s shoes, that imagine magical futures, that remember, and that make us visible.</p>

          <p>Using/creating existing markers in the world (stickers, statues, enchanted pebbles) as breadcrumbs and tags, we will collaboratively create exciting, delightful, and subversive stories of our city and communities - real and imagined experiences that reveal new ways of seeing the world, to tell stories, to explore identities, to call for action, to subvert symbols of power, and to delight.</p>
