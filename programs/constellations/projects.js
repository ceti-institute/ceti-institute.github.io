Video drawn from live performances and scientific imaging are mixed and shifted in response to sound giving viewers a glimpse at the layers of shimmering ecologies in which we human animals are enmeshed and dependent. Sound responsive creative coding mixes and alters both the layers of video and the sequence and timing of scene changes mimicking the non linear interplay of ecological processes, climate change and human activity. Projection mapping onto a translucent sculpture inspired by forms from nature, underscores the universality of organic processes.',

Video drawn from live performances and scientific imaging are mixed and shifted in response to sound, with imagery of natural disaster, mass migration and partisan resistance to fascism. Creative coding mixes and alters both the layers of video and the sequence and timing of scene changes mimicking the non linear interplay of ecological processes, climate crisis and the unspoken sense of dread underlying our daily lives, as the point of no return from climate collapse draws ever closer.',
