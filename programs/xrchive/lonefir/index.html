          <h1>XRchive: Lone Fir</h1>
          <h2>(Hi)stories and Visions of Block 14</h2>

          <p>In one corner of the Lone Fir Cemetery — Block 14, a neglected open field, lies a mass grave with no markers. The people buried here were primarily Chinese immigrants and their families - laborers and railroad workers — whose role in building this city remains unacknowledged, whose stories were erased, and whose bodies were interred with no visible headstones or marking. A hundred years ago, many of the men were disinterred and sent to China but many of the women and children’s bodies remained - another forced displacement and family separation. Their bodies were discovered in 2004 when a preliminary excavation (the county was trying to sell the land to developers) unearthed traces - a shoe, perhaps a bit of clothing, bones — evidence that shines a powerful light on Portland’s racist past. The area remains barren and unacknowledged (there is now a sign erected this past year). There are aspirations and plans to eventually create a physical memorial in the space that have been postponed and delayed. While there have been conversations, investigations, and planning, there has been little action in officially acknowledging and reckoning with this horrific history.</p>

          <p>After a year of community engagement, relationship building and listening/planning sessions around XRchive, we prioritized this story about Block 14 of the Lone Fir Cemetery as a key topic to focus on.</p>

          <p>CETI, in collaboration with a broad and diverse community of participants and partners, proposes to create a series of immersive and interactive experiences using emerging technologies and the creative imagination and fragmented memories of a collective of artists, technologists, storytellers, and community members, to tell the stories of these (for the moment nameless) Chinese communities so integral to the creation of our city; to acknowledge, to remember, and to celebrate their contributions. We will center the voices and stories of the communities involved and collaborate with and draw upon the work done already in planning a potential physical memorial and use these ideas as inspiration. We intend to hold community listening and brainstorming sessions ending in a creative design-build sessions to create more final versions.</p>
