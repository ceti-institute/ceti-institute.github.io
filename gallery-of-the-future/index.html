Our sex positive platform creates a safe space for marginalized voices, and their passion for the provocative. We are lust. We are fantasy. We are grandeur.</p>

										<p>João Rochela (1991) is a visual artist from São Paulo, Brazil. Making images is a way of investigating reality. They are drawn towards the banality of everyday things, the strangeness they often assume when carefully inspected. Our technological artifacts and digital lives. The archaeology of media. Through different mediums, they seek to record and reinvent narratives through the appropriation, combination and resignification of different collected pieces.</p>

They use the Web as a primary medium because they believe that the networks we are so familiar with model the relationships inherent in natural ecosystems and human communities. They construct evolving aural locales using natural and synthetic materials, blurring the separation between individuals and the world around them. These virtual, synthesized places demonstrate the interdependence and co-location of seemingly separate places and events. Their work can be experienced by anyone with a computer anywhere in the world, including people who wouldn't feel comfortable entering a white box gallery.</p>

										<p>Ice Scape exists somewhere between two well-loved mall staples: the big fountain and the ice rink.  It’s a space literally frozen in time, where visitors can go to “chill.”   Listen to nature sounds.  Throw a penny in the fountain. Glide over ice puddles.  Eat some mall snacks and leave your trash behind—everybody does it!  You can even skate on the fountain ice.  Use way points to get around faster, and move between fountain and ground levels. (Hold space and click the avatar icons.) If you look closely, you can still see evidence of by-gone mall life frozen in the layers of ice.</p>

Inspired by dreams and intuition, their work depicts potential post-dystopian peace and adaptation of beings within ethereal landscapes. Their methods include meditation drawing, spills, spray paint, brush, and carving the painting surface to develop a sensation of ethereal, impermanence. Saturated colors, neons, iridescents, metallics and mattes play with the tension between layers and space.</p>

										<p>I used the time spent locked up in my room during the fires thinking a lot about breathing. I wanted to learn more about Blender - specifically how to bake in morph targets and animations into some simple geometry, as I'm not an experienced 3D modeler. What emerged was this sort of primitive, breathing, heart - a bit mangled, a bit gasping.</p>

She feels abundantly that social norms and philosophy affect our brain, and that thoughts that are the main process of conceptual works . In her drawings, perspectives of point of view, self-control, concepts around distraction, attraction, and racism are explored. She strongly believes our vision is everything for us that survive and nurture our mind, feeding thoughts and psychological concept of EFT(emotional freedom technique).

As a Filipina-American in Japan, they hope their imperfect knowledge of Ilokano and Japanese lead to a child-like manipulation of language resulting in playful and humorous results of Concrete Poetry. </p>

His work is a fusion of modern and traditional instruments and improvisational techniques. In creating this work, his wishes to suggest a way of hearing music that was a fusion of form and anti-form - a kind of sound sculpture in non-dimensional space. In doing this, it explores the limits to which these elements could be pushed out of sync while still retaining an emotional register. Dirtmall is an expression of the artist's feelings about the limits of freedom in a techno-fetishistic and capitalist society.</p>

										<p>Diego Morales-Portillo is a multidisciplinary artist and designer (and immigrant) born in Guatemala. Diego had presented work in Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Italy, Korea, Spain and the US. Through an iconoclastic, epistemological and historicist study, Morale-Portillo focuses on the revision of the symbols of everyday life as a byproduct of liquid postmodernity. Failure, absurdity and black humor are used to create impossible or imaginary spaces. The visual language of his work represents his own mestizo identity: ambiguous between North and South, West and East; and the failure of the tragicomedy of the reality in which we exist due to the western imperialism.</p>

								<h2>Our Challenge</h2>
								<p>As the world is transformed by pandemics and revolutions, as physical spaces, access, and connection is lost, we reimagine the gallery spaces of the future. What could it look like? How can the art, the space, and the conversations and interactions critically engage with the world and with our communities? How does it spark and sustain inspiration - with ideas, materials, and media? How does it reveal what is possible, and what needs to change?</p>
								<p>We imagine an evolving space, changing in response to community needs and technology/media innovations.  A space created by artists, technologists, and communities together - a space to collaboratively experiment, learn, play, engage, and create.</p>
								<p>CETI will convene groups of artists, technologists, theorists, and community members to create prototypes of future galleries; and launch exhibitions and dialogues to reimagine what co-created  inclusive, accessible, virtual gallery spaces might/should reveal about our world and what it might become.</p>
								<p>The exhibitions/conversations/creations that activate these spaces will focus on reimagining - destroying, repurposing, and rebuilding systems, objects, places, and structures, to envision a future that is equitable, community-focussed, and inspiring.</p>
								<p><br><br></p>

								<h2 style="white-space:nowrap;">Prototype/Experiment 1</h2>
								<h3>Gallery Prototype I: Summer/Fall 2020</h3>
								<h4>Theme</h4>
								<p>Our first gallery iteration is an "abandoned mall", created  through an experimental collaborative virtual creative jam.  From August 6, 2020 to September 1, 2020, we held a series of sprints and design-build sessions to brainstorm, experiment, prototype and create the first  Gallery of the Future.</p>
								<p>The Gallery will  open to the public and for exhibitions on October 23nd, 2020.  Check back here for details and an invitation to our Launch Reception and the Opening for our first Exhibition.</p>
