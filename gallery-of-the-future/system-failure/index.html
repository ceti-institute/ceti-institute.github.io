              <p>João Rochela (1991) is a visual artist from São Paulo, Brazil. Making images is a way of investigating reality. They are drawn towards the banality of everyday things, the strangeness they often assume when carefully inspected. Our technological artifacts and digital lives. The archaeology of media. Through different mediums, they seek to record and reinvent narratives through the appropriation, combination and resignification of different collected pieces.</p>

              <p>Noah Beckham is a non-binary, interdisciplinary, African American artist, who currently resides in Portland, Oregon. Originally from Dayton, Ohio, Noah transitioned to Pacific Northwest College of Art to pursue a fine arts degree. While exploring themes of social justice, self expression, and turning process into meaning, Beckham creates content by: painting, performance work, curating objects, digital collages and writing. This emerging artist practices “Recycling, Reusing, and Renewing” material and documentation, as a way to create a hybrid experience that is accessible both digitally and physically. This practice is evolving into a self -sufficient process that allows the artist to “Deconstruct , Reconstruct, and Reintroduce” an idea.</p>

              <p>Ashlin is a Portland-based sound and software artist involved in placemaking. They use the Web as a primary medium because they believe that the networks we are so familiar with model the relationships inherent in natural ecosystems and human communities. They construct evolving aural locales using natural and synthetic materials, blurring the separation between individuals and the world around them. These virtual, synthesized places demonstrate the interdependence and co-location of seemingly separate places and events. Their work can be experienced by anyone with a computer anywhere in the world, including people who wouldn't feel comfortable entering a white box gallery.</p>

              <p>Ice Scape exists somewhere between two well-loved mall staples: the big fountain and the ice rink. It’s a space literally frozen in time, where visitors can go to “chill.” Listen to nature sounds. Throw a penny in the fountain. Glide over ice puddles. Eat some mall snacks and leave your trash behind—everybody does it! You can even skate on the fountain ice. Use way points to get around faster, and move between fountain and ground levels. (Hold space and click the avatar icons.) If you look closely, you can still see evidence of by-gone mall life frozen in the layers of ice.</p>

Inspired by dreams and intuition, their work depicts potential post-dystopian peace and adaptation of beings within ethereal landscapes. Their methods include meditation drawing, spills, spray paint, brush, and carving the painting surface to develop a sensation of ethereal, impermanence. Saturated colors, neons, iridescents, metallics and mattes play with the tension between layers and space.</p>

              <p>Noah Beckham is a non-binary, interdisciplinary, African American artist, who currently resides in Portland, Oregon. Originally from Dayton, Ohio, Noah transitioned to Pacific Northwest College of Art to pursue a fine arts degree. While exploring themes of social justice, self expression, and turning process into meaning, Beckham creates content by: painting, performance work, curating objects, digital collages and writing. This emerging artist practices “Recycling, Reusing, and Renewing” material and documentation, as a way to create a hybrid experience that is accessible both digitally and physically. This practice is evolving into a self -sufficient process that allows the artist to “Deconstruct, Reconstruct, and Reintroduce” an idea.</p>

In doing this, it explores the limits to which these elements could be pushed out of sync while still retaining an emotional register.

Failure, absurdity and black humor are used to create impossible or imaginary spaces. The visual language of his work represents his own mestizo identity: ambiguous between North and South, West and East; and the failure of the tragicomedy of the reality in which we exist due to the western imperialism.</p>

He received his BFA from the Stamps School at the University of Michigan in 2012 and his MFA from Wayne State University in 2018. His paintings are imagined architectures and landscapes created from combining multiple reference points of extant locations. Human figures are notably absent from these environs but evidence of sentient activity remain. Objects and constructions represented in these works point to possible futures in which the ways that we sustain ourselves have been fundamentally altered. Screen reader support enabled.</p>

              <p>Albert Ortega is most known for his 20 years of Acousmatic practice in Los Angeles having deep involvements across several experimental music scenes. His more recent work explores building augmented & virtual worlds for his sounds to play with as an alternate way of experiencing sound.</p>
              <p>Prior to Covid, he taught an Immersive Sound Design class at USC's School of Cinematic Arts informed not by standard film theory but by applied exhibit design practices and the practice of "object-oriented ontology" (a Graham Harman term) which advocates for giving equal agency to inanimate objects as humans—a great mindset for world building.</p>
