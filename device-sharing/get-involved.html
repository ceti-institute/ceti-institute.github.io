                <h3>Who is this FCC: Device-Sharing Project for?</h3>
                <p>The success of this project depends on creating a broad collaborative network of conors, recipients,
                    volunteers, organisations, and community members. We’d be delighted to find ways for you to
                    participate and help make this project inclusive and impactful.</p>

                    </summary>
                    <p>Anybody who has spare devices (that meet the specs). And we’d be delighted if you can share the
                        project and donation request with your neighbours/friends/family/colleagues.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps you can even do an informal gathering of devices (from your block, community, or from
                        coworkers). Please make sure to share/follow the data removal and prepping instructions. Either have
                        each person fill out the donor form. if possible (or you can collect and fill one out for all).</p>

                    <p>We will have instructions to support the device prep and a few virtual office hrs to help you with
                        questions and the process. Please send an email with and questions to <a

                    </summary>
                    <p>We would like to support anybody who needs a device for education (educators and students and
                        families), for accessing benefits, services and resources, for finding employment, for work, and
                        perhaps to keep in touch with their families/caseworkers/health care providers/counselors/mentors.
                        <em>Please request only one device per person that you will distribute to.</em></p>
                    <p>You are welcome to request a device for yourself. Or perhaps you are a teacher who knows that
                        students (current or former) or their families could use one. Or maybe you know people on your block
                        or apt bldg or neighbourhood or /community group that needs one. Or maybe you are providing services
                        or mentoring (health/counseling/legal/social) and know some people that you work with or provide
                        services or resources to need a device. In which case, you may request devices (of the appropriate
                        kind) for any of these people and commit to collecting and distributing them to those who
                        need/requested one through you.</p>
                    <p>We plan to have a few virtual office hrs to help with minimal troubleshooting to ensure the device
                        works. And are happy to suggest other resources focussed on training. Send ? to <a

                        it. We need help with logistics, with creating websites, with campaigns to get people to participate
                        (and to tell stories about progress), to host drop-off pts, to help deliver/sort/pick-up/distribute
                        devices, to help us find recipients and donors and to help compile results into a lovely
                        report/story and to design a final process to create a decentralised network to share resources when
                        needed.</p>

                    <p>We need spaces to drop off and we’d love for local businesses/organisations to help us by hosting
                        drop-off locations. And we need a host space to help us sort and prepare for distribution. </p>
                    <p>To help provide spaces for drop-off/sorting, please contact hello@ceti.institute. With your name,
                        email, phone and organisation name. We will follow-up to finalize logistics (time, days, process...)
                    </p>
                    <p>We would also appreciate any organisation that addresses this issue (of digital equity) to reach out
                        if they’d like to find ways to partner on/support this project.</p>
                    <p>We will add you all as a partner/sponsor to the project page.</p>
