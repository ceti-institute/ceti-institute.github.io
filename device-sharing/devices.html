          <h1>Fostering a Connected Community: Device Sharing for Digital Access</h1>
          <h2>Devices Needed</h2>
          <p><strong>Dear Donor,</strong></p>
          <p>Thank you so much for considering donations of your spare devices.</p>
          <h3>Notes:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Our focus will be on individual donations and needs, with a quick/scrappy/networked informal process to ensure that everybody in the region and in our communities who might need a device (for whatever reason) will have access to one as soon as we can get it to them.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>NOTE:</strong>Remember that the person you are donating to needs to be able to use the device immediately and might have very little tech understanding and no resources to fix or troubleshoot. Please make sure that the device is undamaged, does not need repair, turns on quickly and that the battery and power cord work to charge the machine.</li>
          </ul>
