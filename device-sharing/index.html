				<h1>Fostering a Connected Community: A Project for Digital Justice</h1>
				<h2>Goal: To ensure that every member of our community in the region has the devices needed to access
					the internet.</h2>
				<h2>Plan: To encourage and enable informal donations of personal spare devices to those who need it by creating a network and process for sharing.</h2>
				<p>In the 21st Century, access to the internet and the devices to use it are essential for survival and
					success. The recent crisis has highlighted the disproportionate impact of the existing digital
					inequity on our marginalized and vulnerable populations, and the urgent need for a remedy.</p>

				<p>We also live in a region with a thriving collaborative and creative community in technology, design,
					and innovation. We’d like to leverage that by creating an informal process and network to
					donate/share our spare functioning devices. We will be quick and scrappy - getting these devices
					into the hands of those who need it as quickly as possible. We need your participation to ensure the
					project is impactful and inclusive.
				</p>

				<h3>How to get involved</h3>
				<p>
					<a href="get-involved.html">Here are some ways</a> you can participate in and support the project.
					And we’re open to
					suggestions and new ideas so please let us know how else you might contribute.
				</p>
				<p>
					We’d be delighted to have you join in whatever capacity that you can. To participate, please fill
					out the forms below:

							volunteer/organizer</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://forms.gle/ufVqkb9keLGSGxTG8" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>to donate

							target='_blank' rel='noopener'>to request devices</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>Please review the <a href="devices.html">types/specs of devices that we need/will collect.</a></p>

				<p>In the process, we will also help save the devices from a landfill, and from gathering dust in our
					spaces. And we will have collectively helped in some small way to mitigate the impacts of this
					crisis on our community.</p>
